## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

- This project is a book rating portal.
- It is possible to login into the system, using a google account or a github account or even login as a guest.
- On the home page it will be possible to see the last books that were rated and if you are logged in, you will be able to see your most recent book rate. 
- It is also possible to see the most popular/best rated books in the Home on the right.
- On the explore page, you can view all the books registered in the system and filter the books both by a search field (book name/author's name) and by category.
- When clicking on a book on this screen, a modal will open where all the reviews of that book will be, its average score, its total pages and its categories.
- If you are logged into the system, it will also be possible to view a profile screen with the evaluations you have already made, total pages read, authors and the category you read the most. You can also search your book reviews.
- Once logged out, you will be able to see the profile of the users who have left a review, but to leave your review you will need to log in and when you try to do this, a modal will open asking you to login to the application.
